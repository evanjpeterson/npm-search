# Technical Take Home

## A few notes

- Searches happen as you type. The search query is debounced to prevent too many unnecessary network requests.
  - Included the `use-debounce` package for this.
- First time using Emotion, or even css-in-js at all. I enjoyed it, but the outcome might look a little rough. And maybe I overrused the `theme` object, but I was really digging the `theme` object.
- Added a couple icons -- brought in `fontawesome` and its basic icon set.
- Did the extra credit.
- I wouldn't say UI design is my strong suit (heh, you might not either) but I tried to come up with something that's workable on both desktop and mobile (tested down to iPhone 5/SE via Chrome dev tools)
